*FOR THE TEAM ENIGMA MEMBERS AND MENTOR:*

Description and Purpose of each file:
1. colours.txt: all the colour options provided by KivyMD for different elements (Note: the background can be either dark or light)
2. enigma.py: the base developement file written with python and kv lang
3. icons.py: the script provided by Kivy to check all the icons and symbols provided by the library for use
4. logo: CONQUER MARS 
5. main.py: the base developement file written with python and no kv lang (except for the screen manager part)

IMPORTANT: If the Judges dont allow us usage of KV lang (which would be a kinda dumb decision) we will be left with 3 options:-
1. We will have to somehow either write entire app in pure python 
2. Give up on spot
3. Fight with them and make them allow usage of KV language

#They better allow us inline KV lang because it would be like we are writing some inline json inside python and calling that script entirely json or not calling it a python script#

Good luck boys!
